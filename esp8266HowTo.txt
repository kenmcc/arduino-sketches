Connections:
Using the cp2012, connect +5v, 0v as normal
Connect RXD and TXT to RX and TX, i.e. not crossed over
Connect GPIOZero to ground while powering on to enable boot mode.

Using arduino, select USBtinyISP as the programmer, and the correct serial port
Occasionally get an "espcomm_open failed" message, try to power it on again.


Now using the wee board and the cp2012, connect it up, slide the prog jumper down, then the power

upload using 'paralell programmer'

For RFID stuff, 
https://github.com/Jorgen-VikingGod/ESP8266-MFRC522#libraries

and the following mapping works ok with the ESP

MISO - GPIO12 (hw spi)
MOSI - GPIO13 (hw spi)
SCK  - GPIO14 (hw spi)
SS   - GPIO02 (free GPIO)
RST  - GPIO05 (free GPIO)

plus ground and vcc (3.3v)
